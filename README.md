- Hi, I'm Priya!
- I'd like to introduce myself as a data enthusiast :)
- Which means, I'm curious to learn anything that will help me to unleash the potential information that a given data set has to offer.
- If we have to speak in corporate vocabulary, feel free to call me a data analyst :p
- But one shall never limit their vocabulary, so give me the space to incorporte more terms into my profile
- such as data engineer :D
